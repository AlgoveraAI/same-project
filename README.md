# SAME Mono Private
This repository is a temporary repository until we decide to open source it. It contains the SDK, the CLI and tests for both. When we open source it, we will move it to a common public repo (removing all history), and use that repo for binary storage as well (binaries are currently stored in same-cli-test).
